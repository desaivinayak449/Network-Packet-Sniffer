# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Network Packet Sniffer

A real-time network packet sniffer built with **Python** and **Scapy**. This tool captures and analyzes network packets, extracts important header information, and displays protocol-level details‚Äîperfect for learning, debugging, and diagnostics.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Live packet capturing from network interfaces
- Parses and displays:
  - Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP headers
  - Source & destination IPs and ports
  - Protocol types and flags
- Easy-to-understand console output
- Lightweight and extensible

---

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Install with:

```bash
pip install scapy

üöÄ Usage
1. Run the sniffer:
  sudo python3 sniffer.py
You may need to run it with sudo to access raw sockets.
2. Output Example
  [+] Packet Captured:
        Ethernet Frame:
            Source MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
            Destination MAC: ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa
        IP Packet:
            Source IP: 192.168.1.10
            Destination IP: 172.217.27.46
            Protocol: TCP
        TCP Segment:
            Source Port: 50321
            Destination Port: 443
            Flags: SYN

            print(f"    TCP Segment:\n        Source Port: {tcp.sport}\n        Destination Port: {tcp.dport}\n        Flags: {tcp.flags}")
        elif UDP in packet:
            udp = packet[UDP]
            print(f"    UDP Segment:\n        Source Port: {udp.sport}\n        Destination Port: {udp.dport}")
        elif ICMP in packet:
            icmp = packet[ICMP]
            print(f"    ICMP Packet:\n        Type: {icmp.type}\n        Code: {icmp.code}")
